Provider is : Amazon.

We start by looking for the IP adress of slash16.org using the commande:

- nslookup slash16.org

which gives a result like this:

Server:10.51.1.42
Address:10.51.1.42#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:slash16.org
Address: 143.204.222.49
Name:slash16.org
Address: 143.204.222.73
Name:slash16.org
Address: 143.204.222.8
Name:slash16.org
Address: 143.204.222.156

Then we use one of the IP adress to check the provider using the commande:

- whois 143.204.222.156

Which gives a result like this:

Amazon Technologies Inc. AT-88-Z (NET-143-204-0-0-1) 143.204.0.0 - 143.204.255.255
Amazon.com, Inc. AMAZO-CF (NET-143-204-0-0-2) 143.204.0.0 - 143.204.255.255

or we can use some website on internet to find that using the IP Address.
